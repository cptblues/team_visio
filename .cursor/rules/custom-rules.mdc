# Agora.io Video and Audio Rules

When implementing real-time communication:
- Use the Agora.io Web SDK.
- Initialize the client with `AgoraRTC.createClient({ mode: "rtc", codec: "vp8" })`.
- Automatically join channels and publish audio/video streams on room entry.
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks.

Applies to: src/lib/agora/*.js

# Firebase Integration Rules

When working with Firebase:
- Use the official Firebase Web SDK for Firestore and Authentication.
- Structure data in collections like `users`, `sessions`, and `rooms`.
- Use `onSnapshot` for real-time updates from Firestore.
- Avoid hardcoding Firebase configuration; reference it from environment variables.

Applies to: src/lib/**/*.{js,ts}

# Project Structure Guidelines

Follow this structure:
- Place Svelte components in `src/components`.
- Place utility functions (e.g., Firebase, Agora.io) in `src/lib`.
- Use `src/routes` for routing if SvelteKit is used.
- Keep configuration files in the project root.

Applies to: src/**/*.{svelte,js,ts}

# Security Best Practices

For security:
- Never hardcode sensitive data like API keys, Agora App IDs, or Firebase credentials.
- Use environment variables (e.g., `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`).
- Delegate sensitive operations to Firebase Cloud Functions when possible.

Applies to: src/**/*.*

# Svelte Component Guidelines

When generating code for Svelte components:
- Use Svelte's reactive declarations (e.g., `$:`, `let`) for state management.
- Bind events declaratively (e.g., `on:click={handleClick}`).
- Avoid React or Vue.js patterns like hooks or directives.
- Place components in `src/components`.

Applies to: src/components/**/*.svelte

Reference: @file .cursor/rules/firebase-integration.md
# Svelte Stores Management

For state management:
- Use Svelte stores (`writable`, `readable`) for global state (e.g., user data, room status).
- Update stores reactively when Firebase or Agora.io data changes.
- Import stores into components with `import { storeName } from '$lib/stores'`.

Applies to: src/**/*.{svelte,js,ts}
